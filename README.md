## Hi there 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on modern JavaScript frameworks like **React**, **Next.js**, and **Vue.js**. I bring real-world experience from working with teams at **Bytebridge IT Solutions LLC**, **RBS TECH LIMITED**, and others.

I enjoy building clean, scalable interfaces and always aim for pixel-perfect, high-performance UI. Whether it's a mobile app with **React Native** or a server-rendered app with **Next.js**, I’m all about creating smooth, intuitive user experiences.

Currently expanding my skills in **TypeScript** and exploring deeper architecture patterns in modern frontend development.
