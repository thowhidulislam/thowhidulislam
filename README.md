## Hi there 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience, focused on building scalable and performant frontend applications. My core expertise lies in **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **React Native**, where I've contributed to both web and mobile projects with strong UI/UX principles.

I have hands-on experience with **Vue.js**, **Redux**, and **TypeScript**, and I'm comfortable working across diverse codebases. I use **Git** for version control and follow modern development workflows to ensure clean, maintainable code.

Adaptable and growth-driven, I thrive in collaborative environments and am always exploring new technologies. I'm currently open to opportunities where I can bring value as a frontend developer and continue to evolve professionally.
